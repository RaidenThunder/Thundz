**Thundz - Machine Learning Portfolio**
Welcome to **Thundz**, a professional showcase of advanced machine learning projects demonstrating expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Designed for the Senior Workforce Management Analyst role, this portfolio highlights data analysis, modeling, and visualization skills to derive actionable insights for workforce optimization, employee engagement, and performance analytics.

**Projects**

**NLP: IMDB Review Analysis:**

Analyzes 620 IMDB movie reviews using NLP techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and bigram modeling. Features interactive visualizations (word clouds, bar plots, PCA scatter plots) to uncover sentiment patterns and key terms.

**Why It Matters:** Showcases text analytics skills to process employee feedback, survey responses, or performance reviews, enabling data-driven workforce strategies.

**Key Skills:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, Plotly, sentiment analysis, data visualization.

**DNN: Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification:**

Implements a Deep Neural Network to classify cat and dog images from the cats_vs_dogs dataset, comparing multiple architectures, regularization techniques (Dropout, L2), and optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, Adam). Includes visualizations like accuracy/loss curves and confusion matrices.

**Why It Matters:** Demonstrates classification expertise applicable to categorizing employee performance metrics, engagement scores, or visual feedback for workforce analytics.

**Key Skills:** TensorFlow, deep learning, model optimization, performance evaluation, data preprocessing.

**CNN: Coming Soon:** Planned project leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for advanced image-based analytics, such as sentiment analysis from employee-generated visual data (e.g., workplace event images).

**Why It Matters:** Extends classification capabilities to multimedia workforce data, enhancing predictive analytics.
